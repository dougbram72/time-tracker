- Progressive enhancement approach
- Excellent mobile performance
- Simpler development and debugging
- SEO-friendly by default

**Cons:**
- Less rich interactivity compared to SPA frameworks
- Some duplication between server and client state

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Vue.js SPA**: Rejected due to bundle size and mobile performance concerns
- **React**: Rejected for similar reasons as Vue.js
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Rejected due to development complexity

#### Consequences
- Faster mobile loading times
- Simpler deployment (no build step complexity)
- Limited to progressive enhancement patterns

### ADR-003: SQLite for Development Database
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  

#### Context
Need a reliable database for development with easy setup, while maintaining production scalability options.

#### Decision
Use SQLite for development and MySQL 8.0 for production deployment.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Zero-configuration setup for development
- Excellent Laravel integration through Eloquent
- Fast development iterations and testing
- Easy database reset and seeding
- Production flexibility with MySQL option
- ACID compliance for data integrity

**Cons:**
- Different databases between dev and production
- SQLite limitations for concurrent writes (not an issue for single-user development)

#### Alternatives Considered
- **MySQL for both**: Rejected due to development setup complexity
- **PostgreSQL**: Rejected due to team familiarity preference
- **SQLite for production**: Rejected due to scalability limitations

#### Consequences
- Faster development setup and iteration
- Need to test production deployment with MySQL

### ADR-004: Polymorphic Relationship for Time Entries
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  

#### Context
Time entries need to be associated with either Projects or Issues, requiring a flexible data model.

#### Decision
Use Laravel's polymorphic relationships with `trackable_type` and `trackable_id` fields.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Single table for all time entries
- Flexible association with different entity types
- Clean Laravel implementation
- Easy to extend for new trackable types

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex queries
- Foreign key constraints require additional consideration

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Separate tables**: Rejected due to complexity and duplication
- **Union approach**: Rejected due to query complexity

#### Consequences
- Flexible data model for future extensions
- Consistent time entry handling regardless of type
- Requires careful handling of foreign key relationships

### ADR-005: Mobile-First Design Approach
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  

#### Context
Primary use case involves frequent context switching on mobile devices during development work.

#### Decision
Adopt mobile-first design principles with touch-friendly interfaces and optimized mobile performance.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Addresses primary use case of mobile context switching
- Better performance on resource-constrained devices
- Forces focus on essential features
- Progressive enhancement for desktop

**Cons:**
- Desktop experience may be less rich
- Additional complexity in responsive design

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Desktop-first**: Rejected due to primary mobile use case
- **Separate mobile app**: Rejected due to development complexity

#### Consequences
- All interfaces designed for touch interaction
- Performance optimizations prioritize mobile
- Desktop features are additive, not primary

### ADR-006: Single Active Timer Constraint
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  

#### Context
Need to decide whether users can run multiple timers simultaneously or enforce single active timer.

#### Decision
Enforce single active timer constraint - starting a new timer automatically stops the previous one.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Prevents accidental double-tracking
- Simpler user interface and mental model
- Matches real-world work patterns (can't work on two things simultaneously)
- Easier to implement and maintain

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility for users who want to track overlapping activities
- May not suit all workflow patterns

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Multiple active timers**: Rejected due to complexity and potential for errors
- **Timer queuing**: Rejected as over-engineering for initial version

#### Consequences
- Simpler timer management logic
- Clear user interface with single timer display
- Automatic timer switching behavior
- May need to revisit based on user feedback

### ADR-007: Local Storage for Timer Persistence
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  

#### Context
Need to handle timer state persistence across page reloads and browser sessions, especially on mobile.

#### Decision
Use browser Local Storage to persist active timer state with server synchronization.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Survives page reloads and browser restarts
- Reduces server requests for timer state
- Better mobile experience with intermittent connectivity
- Immediate UI responsiveness

**Cons:**
- Potential for client-server state divergence
- Browser storage limitations
- Privacy considerations

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Server-only state**: Rejected due to mobile connectivity issues
- **Session storage**: Rejected due to limited persistence
- **IndexedDB**: Rejected as over-engineering for simple timer state

#### Consequences
- Requires synchronization logic between client and server
- Better offline experience
- Need to handle state conflicts gracefully

#### Decision
Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling framework.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- Excellent mobile-first responsive utilities
- Small production bundle size through purging
- Consistent design system
- Good Laravel integration

**Cons:**
- Learning curve for utility-first approach
- Verbose HTML classes
- Requires build process

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Bootstrap**: Rejected due to larger bundle size and component-heavy approach
- **Custom CSS**: Rejected due to development time constraints

Implement basic Laravel authentication but design for single-user deployment initially.

#### Rationale
**Pros:**
- Simpler initial implementation
- Faster development for MVP
- Reduces security surface area
- Matches immediate use case

**Cons:**
- Limits future multi-user scenarios
- May need significant refactoring later

#### Alternatives Considered
